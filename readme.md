# EasyPrefix


Easy prefix adds 2 commands to add prefixes and suffixes to vanilla scoreboards.

##Commands
- /prefix <team> <prefix>
- /suffix <team> <suffix>

If the commands are already registered and conflicting, there are 2 alternate aliases, scprefix and scsuffix

As this is an extension to the vanilla minecraft scoreboard, I've re-used the permission needed to change the scoreboard.
```minecraft.command.scoreboard```

The format for the prefixes and suffixes are using the legacy color codes with & as the formatting symbol.
